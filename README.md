```
Hah. Walk in, watching all the eyes turn my way
Locked in, yeah they be asking for a replay
Sorry, I didn't mean to drive you insane
You can try to run but, your heart is mine to
take
It's that energy, it's that spark in me, in the
dark, light up your heart
Crown up on our head
Diamonds forged in red
Shining bright, yeah it's our spotlight
We got that boom, ba bam
Can't help but dance along
You feel that boom, ba bam, ha ha
I know you want some more
Know you can't ignore
So come and get some more
I know you want some more
Lights on when I hit the floor, way I move you
want some more, la la la la
Sugar in your veins, you'll miss me when I'm
gone
Can't stop I was made to soar, when I'm up you
want some more, la la la la
Get what I give, I do what I want
I know you want some more
Yeah, turn it to a hunnid, push it to the limit,
then we go beyond
Energy kinetic, feeling is magnetic, you can't
get enough
Oh baby if you get too close then you can't
blame me
I got that touch of gold, woah
It's that energy, it's that spark in me, in the
dark, light up your heart
Crown up on our head
Diamonds forged in red
Shining bright, yeah it's our spotlight
We got that boom, ba bam
Can't help but dance along
You feel that boom, ba bam, ha ha
I know you want some more
Know you can't ignore
So come and get some more
I know you want some more
Lights on when I hit the floor, way I move you
want some more, la la la la
Sugar in your veins, you'll miss me when I'm
gone
Can't stop I was made to soar, when I'm up you
want some more, la la la la
Get what I give, I do what I want
I know you want some more
I know you want some more
We’re unforgettable
Hit run and dash
Don't get attached
Enjoy while it lasts
We got that boom, ba bam
Can't help but dance along
You feel that boom, ba bam, ha ha
I know you want some more
Know you can't ignore
So come and get some more
I know you want some more
Lights on when I hit the floor, way I move you
want some more, la la la la
Sugar in your veins, you'll miss me when I'm
gone
Can't stop I was made to soar, when I'm up you
want some more, la la la la
Get what I give, I do what I want
I know you want some more
